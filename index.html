                       <p class="def-list">In posture, the core is the human bone structure. Everything else is based on that. Bad posture can lead </br>
                                           to bad circulation, muscle pain, headaches, breathing issues, organ issues, etc. 
                                           A good singers posture may best be approached by finding a foundation built through a neutral position that <br> 
                                           exerts the least amount of energy. body positioning that favors the best functioning of all body parts. <br> 
                                           Such positioning balances the distribution of weight, putting the least strain in muscle, tendons, <br> 
                                           ligaments and bones. Generelly, a singer learns a specific stance, " a go to if all else fails." <br>
                                           This way, if there is any tentition thoughout the body, a singer is able to recall their neutral position<br>
                                           and adjust where the issue is at to relax it. In general, a posture that best fits for a neutrial position is:   <br>
                                           Feet forward and Shoulder width apart, balance of body on front balls of feet, bent knees and a balanced <br>

                       <p class="def-list">Phonation happens when enough pressure comes up against the closed vocal folds that they begin to open and close. This pressure allows air particals through<br>
                                           that vibrate at a given frequency of sound called <strong> the voice. </strong><br>
                                           The vocal cords are composed of twin infoldings of<strong> 3 </strong>distinct tissues: The outer layer is a squamous, non-keratinizing <strong> epithelium. </strong> <br>
                                           Below this is the superficial layer of the <strong>lamina propria,</strong> a gel like layer, which allows the vocal fold to vibrate and produce <br>
                                           sound. The <strong>vocalis muscle</strong> make up the deepest portion. These vocal folds are covered with a mucous membrane <br>
                                           and are stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx.  The inner lining surface of this squamous epithelium is <br>
                                           covered by a layer of mucus that helps to keep the vocal folds moist and lubricated. <br>
                                           The <strong> falsetto </strong> voice is created when the vocalis muscle is left out of the phonatory process and not by the false vocal folds.<strong> <br>
                                           The higher a singer sings, the less of the vocalis is used. </strong> There is also an area between the vocalis and outter <br>
                                           two parts of the vocal folds known as the <strong> passaggio. </strong> The Passaggio is also known as the passage and is the <br>
                                           area that most singer's have issues with. A <strong> vibrato </strong> happens when the muscle's of the larynx are relaxed enough to pulsate to create an even<br>

                      <p class="def-list"> Resonation happens when the vibrations of the phonatory process pass through the bodies. The vibrations bounce off the walls of the chambers<br>
                                           making them vibrate as well. These chambers are where the bodies natural areas of amplification takes place.<br> 
                                           There are two main areas where resonation takes place, the head and chest chambers. <br>
                                           A chamber is an area that has an opening for the voice to enter and a point at which <br>
                                           the voice is obstructed. This obstruction allows the voice to fill the chamber, creating amplification. <br>
                                           Head voice is when more resonation happens in the head and chest voice is when more resonation <br>
                                           happens in the chest. Singers also have a chest plate and a face plate to aid in amplification. More resonation in the chest is best for <br>
                                           lower voiced singers and more in the head for higher voiced singers. Resonation also happens in the Pharynx, Nasal, oral, Sinus cavities,<br>
                                           amoung other places. Some chambers can be trained to create more space for a bigger voice, like an expanded chest with a lowered diaprahm <br>
                                           to create space in the chest cavity. A lowered jaw with a forward tongue as well as a loward larynx with a lifted soft palate helps create <br>
                                           more space in the oral and pharynx cavities. Flaring the nostrils can help the nasil cavity too. It is importand to remember that muscles <br>
                                           can and do sit over singers resonating chambers that can and do affect them. </p>

                      <p class="def-list"> A vowel is a syllabic speech sound that is pronounced without any stricture in <br>
                                           the vocal tract. There are 5 pure vowels that all other vowels are a mix of. <br>
                                           these 5 pure vowels also consist of no dipthongs are<tr> <td class="ipa">(ɛ, e, ɑ, ɔ, u).</td> <tr> <br>

                                           it establishes a good mouth embouchure that aids a singer with diction.<br>
                                           unfortunitly, some of these vowels also carry bad habbits like dipthongs and <br>

                                           the cheeks and upper lip to allow sound to hit the hard surface of the teeth to <br>
                                           create a brighter sound. Good diction happens when the jaw is lowered, the toungue <br>
                                           is forward, and the lips are more puckered. This happens because the singers <br>
                                           articulators are closer together and don't need to take the time to keep repositioning <br>
                                           for articulation. A glide is any musclar movement needed in the articulatory process. <br>
                                           In particular, the (W) as in we, the (Y) as in you, and the glottal (H) as in hot. </p>

                      <p class="def-list"> A consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with all or partial closure of the vocal tract. There aer an array of<br>
                                           consonants a singer has at their disposal. Voice Fricitives (v,th,z)  really help loosen the muscles of the articulators through <br>
                                           their vibrations. Unvoiced Fricitives (f,s, and <tr> <td class="ipa"> ʃ, </td> <tr> aka:sh) really help a singer with support because of the air blockedge created. The voice<br>
                                           Plosives (p,t, and k) can act like a clapper of a bell to help energize the resonating chambers. The (v) and (f) are produced by the same articulators, the only<br>
                                           difference is one uses the phonation to produce it and the other does not.  The (s),(z) consonants are the same respectively. The nasil consonants (m,n, and <tr> <td class="ipa"> ŋ, </td> <tr> aka:	ng) really help to<br>
                                           activate the resonation in the chambers. The Unvoice plosives, or implosives (B,d,g) are very helpful to understand the ratio of support between consonants <br>
                                           and vowels. Think lip and tongue trills. </p>

                      <p class="def-list"> The focus is the deliberate muscular movements that are focused in an area to produce a sound that <br> 
                                           can be well heard and understood. Almost every room has a focal point. A central point that all sound <br>
                                           vibrations are naturally drawn to by the acoustics of the room. This is the point in the room that all <br> 
                                           sound returns to after bouncing off the surfaces in the room. A focused voice is like a focused laser beam,<br>
                                           it concentrates the voice to the focal point in the room to create more sound and use less air. There is <br>
                                           also the focusing of the eyes...There is a fine line between "daggar eyes" and the "deer in the headlight eyes."<br>
                                  <strong> The Mask </strong> is the functional unity of the facial muscles, the Temporalis muscles, and the Occipitalis muscle. <br>
                                           there is a slight lift in these muscles to thin out the muscles over resonating areas. The lift of the Mask combind<br>
                                           with the forward placement of the articulators acts like a pipe from an organ. </p>

                      <p class="def-list"> An overtone is any tone greater than the fundamental frequency of a sound and together are called harmonics. <br>
                                           Harmonic partials, are partials whose frequencies are numerical integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. <br>
                                           The fundamental note being sung in a given room vibrates at a specific Hz causing a secondary vibration in said room. <br>
                                           This secondary vibration is double the Hz of the fundamental frequency of an octave higher and is known as the 1st over tone. <br>
                                           The vibration from the 1nd over tone creates a 3rd over tone that is double the Hz of the 1st overtone making it an octave and a <br>
                                           fifth above the fundamental note being sung. Each over tone being double the Hz of the tone below it. </p>

                                            needs to create at least 7 Formants to naturally sing over any size orchestra in any size room. </p> </div>

                       <p class="healthy"> Keeping hydrated is extreemly important and not just for singers. Keeping a water bottle by at all times is essential. <br> 
                           Our bodies are about 60% water, the brain and heart are composed of about 73% water, and the lungs are about 83% water. <br>
                           The skin contains 64% water, muscles and kidneys are 79%, and even the bones are watery: 31%. Water is what circulates <br>
                           oxygen throughout the body. Singers must be mindful of how much and when to drink water becaue it takes a good 24 hours <br>
                           for water to hydrate and keep the Vocal folds moist, flexable and ready to sing. Drinking alot of water just before singing <br>
                           will only aid in filling up the bladder and the need to empty it. </p>

                           manage, especially for busy life styles. Heavy Foods and anything creamy before singing can be counter productive, because it saps <br>
                           energy to digest the Heavy foods and anything creamy can coat the Vocal Folds, making it dificult to phonate. </p>

                            a daily yoga regiment is a must and learning what streatches and breathing components are good to do before vocal warm ups to make sure <br>
                            the body as a whole is warmed up and ready. </p>

                        <p class="healthy"> Vocal warm ups are just as important as warming up for any athletic venture. There are a couple warm ups that are guaranteed to <br>
                            pack a good punch for your buck. The first is called the "Yawn-sigh" and is just a vocal sigh from the upper range down on a vowel. <br>
                            Best starting vowel is the <tr> <td class="ipa"> (ɑ) </td> <tr> vowel because it's an open vowel to help create space. Changing vowels <br>
                            and being mindful of what each vowel brings to the table and what each one takes away. Adding a consonant at the begining of each "Yawn-sigh" <br>
                            can spice it up a bit too.. This is a great opertunity to note how to <br>
                            incorperate what each vowel brings and throwing out what each one takes away. vocal warm ups also help to shake any gunk on your Vocal <br>
                            Folds that would interfear in the phonating process. Another really good vocal warm up are trills. Lip and tongue trills are basicly <br>
                            the mother load of warm ups because they incorperate the "Yawn-sigh warm up and naturally throws in a good blend of support and mix of <br>
                            air through the Vocal Folds. </p>
                            
        
        
        
                                             <h1 id="vocalizing"> Vocal Exercises </h1>
        
        
                        <p class="healthy">  Vocal exercises are any exercises designed to improve consistancy through out the range of the voice, as well as, consistancy <br>
                                             through out the line in phrasing of songs. There is a phrase that is important to singers called the Vocal Connection. <br>
                                             This connection is from the nasil area in what's called the "snarl sensation" to the diaprahmatic area as a whole that <br>
                                             acts like an anchor that hooks up into the nasil aria. Every thing in between these two areas are called the vocal tract. <br>
                                             Another important phrase is the Passaggio, otherwise known as the area of passage between the musclur portion and the outter <br>
                                             layers. Most people have at least one area in their range that is dificult to sing through and often times ends up with a singer <br>
                                             cracking their voice. Any staccato exercice helps to strengthen the diaphramatic area to create a firm foundation creating an anchor, <br>
                                             doing it with scales on just vowels first and then adding consonants.<br>
                                             Also, using the friench nasil vowel <tr> <td class="ipa"> (ɛ̃) </td> <tr> as in Bien for any scale really helps to activate the "Snarl 
                                             Sinsation". These two exercises really pack a punch for that "Vocal Connection." Now the Passaggio is a hug issue for most singers. <br>
                                             Yawn sigh descending from falsetto down to  begin mixing the vocalis, it helps to add more of an H when working through this area <br>
                                             to help "lighten" the area enough to blend them together as a smooth functional unity. It doesn't matter what voice type you are, <br>
                                             the Passiggio might be different for a low voice compared to a higher voice, but the physiology is still the same as far as what <br>
                                             the issue is. Learning how to lession the amount of phonation in the vocalis muscle while singing an asending line is very importan, <br>
                                             just like singing a decending phrase to learn how to blend more of the vocalis muscle in the phonatory process. Another vocal ecercise <br>
                                             is holding the (s) consonant for counted beats, each time holding it for a longer beat. This is great to aid in suport and consistancy <br>
                                             thouugh out a phrase in a song. Another really good one is a staccato triplet vocal exercise. Staying on the same tone and producing <br>
                                             the three voiceless fricitives (f,s, and <tr> <td class="ipa"> ʃ, </td> <tr> aka:sh) in a tripolet rythem repeated. The other really cool<br>
                                             consonants to do this on is with the Plosives (p,t, and k). It's is important to try to sneak a quick breath in between each staccato sung. <br>
                                             Lastly, just like in any athletic venture, you have to prepare!!! It is important for a singer to warm up and vocalize for an hour each day.<br>
                                             This does not include the time a singer needs to put in to learn their music!!! </P> 
                                             
                                             
          <p> I have found that life is more bearable when one has some sort of spititual connection. <br>
              The who, what, when, where, and Why is up to you. Some find that just meditation works for them, <br>
              as for me, I find that my connection is with the LDS church and that works for me. My wish <br>
              for anyone is to have light, love, and happieness. Peace be with you. <br>
