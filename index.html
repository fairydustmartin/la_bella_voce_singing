        <h2> Joaquina Calvo Johnson </h2>
        
      <p> Joaquina retired after 25 years from Yuba College in Marysville, <br>
      california as a professor of music in 2003. however, she kept a private <br> 
      voice studio and continued to work as artistic director for both the Yuba Sutter <br>
      Master Chorale and the Borgamaria Lyric Opera company.</p>
      
      <p>  Joaquina volinteered as president of the Yuba-Sutter Regional Arts Council,<br>
      which which she had been involved with since its inception totaling about 25 years. <br>
      Through the council, she was involved with the arts education outreach program,<br>
      which was very dear to her heart, and the Special Arts program, <br>
      which is hosted by the council every spring for children who are <br>
      physically and mentally impaired. The council also participates in various<br>
      community events, such as the Christmas Stroll and the Harvest Festival.
      </p>
      
      <p> Joaquina aslo sat on the board of directors for the Tri-County Concert Association,<br>
      which she enjoy very much. The group worked very hard to bring internationally acclaimed <br>
      artists to the Yuba-Sutter community. Other organizations was involved with were <br> 
      the American Chorale Directors Association and the National Association of Teachers of Singing. <p/>
      
      <p> Joaquina went to see our maker in the year Aug 14, 2012 after a battle with pancreatic cancer.<br>
      She was 74 years young. This website is dedicated to her and her knowledge I hope to share<br>
      on the Italian style of beautiful singing called <strong>la bella voce</strong>. <p/>

      <h3> Posture </h3>
          <p> In humans, posture can provide a significant amount of important information through nonverbal communication.<br>
              Psychological studies have also demonstrated the effects of body posture on emotions. The theories that guide <br> 
              research in this field are the self-validation or perception theory and the embodied emotion theory. </br>
              A good singers posture may best be approached by finding a foundation built through a neutral position that <br> 
              exerts the least amount of energy. body positioning that favors the best functioning of all body parts. <br> 
              Such positioning balances the distribution of weight, putting the least strain in muscle, tendons, <br> 
              ligaments and bones. </p>
            
      <h3> Breathing </h3>  
           <p> Breathing (or ventilation) is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs to facilitate gas exchange <br>
               with the internal environment, mostly by bringing in oxygen and flushing out carbon dioxide. <P/>
               
           <p> All aerobic creatures need oxygen for cellular respiration, which uses the oxygen to break down foods for energy <br> 
               and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. The body's circulatory system transports these gases to and from the ,<br>
               cells, where "cellular respiration" takes place. Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, <br>
               and unconsciously, controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and <br> 
               oxygen in the arterial blood constant.<p/>

           <p> During the process of deep breathing, the thoracic diaphragm adopts a lower position in the core and this helps to <br>
               generate intra-abdominal pressure which strengthens the lumbar spine.<p/>
          
       <h3> Support </h3>
            <p> The amount of Vocal intensity is proportional based on the note(s) being sang, the length of time of the note(s), <br> 
                Phrasing, Volume, and Performance room. Too much is pushing and can cause tension in the vocal track. <p/>
           
       <h3> Phonation </h3> 
            <p> The vocal cords, also known as vocal folds, are folds of tissue in the Larynx that are key in creating sounds. <br>
                They are composed of twin infoldings of mucous membrane stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx. <br>
                They vibrate, modulating the flow of air being expelled from the lungs during phonation. The Glottis is the area created <br>
                when the vocal folds are open, when the glottis is closed and enough air pressure is built up in the sub-glottis, the Vocal <br>
                Folds begin the phonology process by flapping back and forth creating a vibration and sound. </p>
          
            <p> The vocal cords are composed of twin infoldings of 3 distinct tissues: The outer layer is squamous, non-keratinizing epithelium. <br>
                Below this is the superficial layer of the lamina propria, a gel like layer, which allows the vocal fold to vibrate and produce <br>
                sound. The vocalis and thyroarytenoid muscles make up the deepest portion. These vocal folds are covered with a mucous membrane <br>
                and are stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx.  The inner lining surface of this squamous epithelium is <br>
                covered by a layer of mucus (acting as a mucociliary clearance), which is composed of two layers: a mucinous layer and serous layer. <br>
                Both mucus layers provide viscous and watery environment for cilia beating posteriorly and superiorly. The mucociliary clearance <br>
                keeps the vocal folds essentially moist and lubricated. </p>
          
          <h3> Resonation </h3>
               <p> Resonation chambers are the bodies natural areas of amplification takes place. The two main places that resonation takes place are <br>
                   the head and the thoracic chamber. Head voice is when more resonation happens in the head and chest voice is when more resonation <br>
                   happens in the chest. More resonation in the chest is best for lower voiced singers and more in the head for higher voiced singers. <br>
                   Resonation also happens in the Pharynx, Nasal, and Sinus cavities. </p>
          
            <h3> Vowels </h3>
                 <p> A vowel is a syllabic speech sound that is pronounced without any stricture in the vocal tract </p>
            
            <h3> Consonants </h3>
                 <p> A consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with all or partial closure of the vocal tract. </p>
            
            <h3> Focus </h3>
                 <p> The focus is the deliberate muscular movements that are focused in an area to produce a sound that <br> 
                     can be well heard and understood. Almost every room has a focal point. A central point that all sound <br>
                     vibrations are naturally drawn to by the acoustics of the room. This is the point in the room that all <br> 
                     sound returns to after bouncing off the surfaces in the room. </p>
    
            <h3> Over Tones </h3>
                 <p> An overtone is any frequency greater than the fundamental frequency of a sound and together are called harmonics. <br>
                     Harmonic partials, are partials whose frequencies are numerical integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. <br>
                     The fundamental note being sung in a given room vibrates at a specific Hz causing a secondary vibration in said room. <br>
                     This secondary vibration is double the Hz of the note being sung that is an octave higher and is known as the 1st over tone. <br>
                     The vibration from the 1nd over tone creates a 3rd over tone that is double the Hz of the 1st  and making it an octave and a <br>
                     fifth above the fundamental note being sung. Each over tone being double the Hz of the tone below it. </p>
    
            <h3> Formants </h3>
                 <p> Formance are groupings of over tones in a given room. These groupings of over tones are created by the fundamental tone <br>
                     being sung by the singer and are also created in each resonating chamber of the singer that amplifies the voice into <br>
                     the given room. </p>
