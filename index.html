      <p align="center"> Joaquina retired after 25 years from Yuba College in Marysville, <br>
      california as a professor of music in 2003. however, she kept a private <br> 
      voice studio and continued to work as artistic director for both the Yuba Sutter <br>
      Master Chorale and the Borgamaria Lyric Opera company.</p>
      
      <p>  Joaquina volinteered as president of the Yuba-Sutter Regional Arts Council,<br>
      which which she had been involved with since its inception totaling about 25 years. <br>
      Through the council, she was involved with the arts education outreach program,<br>
      which was very dear to her heart, and the Special Arts program, <br>
      which is hosted by the council every spring for children who are <br>
      physically and mentally impaired. The council also participates in various<br>
      community events, such as the Christmas Stroll and the Harvest Festival.
      </p>
      
      <p> Joaquina aslo sat on the board of directors for the Tri-County Concert Association,<br>
      which she enjoy very much. The group worked very hard to bring internationally acclaimed <br>
      artists to the Yuba-Sutter community. Other organizations was involved with were <br> 
      the American Chorale Directors Association and the National Association of Teachers of Singing. <p/>
      
      <p> Joaquina went to see our maker in the year Aug 14, 2012 after a battle with pancreatic cancer.<br>
      She was 74 years young. This website is dedicated to her and her knowledge I hope to share<br>
          on the Italian style of beautiful singing called <strong>la bella voce</strong>. <p/> </div>

           <div id="def"> <p>In humans, posture can provide a significant amount of important information through nonverbal communication.<br>
              Psychological studies have also demonstrated the effects of body posture on emotions. The theories that guide <br> 
              research in this field are the self-validation or perception theory and the embodied emotion theory. </br>
              A good singers posture may best be approached by finding a foundation built through a neutral position that <br> 
              exerts the least amount of energy. body positioning that favors the best functioning of all body parts. <br> 
              Such positioning balances the distribution of weight, putting the least strain in muscle, tendons, <br> 
            ligaments and bones.  </p>

            <p> All aerobic creatures need oxygen for cellular respiration, which uses the oxygen to break down foods for energy <br> 
               and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. The body's circulatory system transports these gases to and from the ,<br>
               cells, where "cellular respiration" takes place. Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, <br>
               and unconsciously, controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and <br> 
               oxygen in the arterial blood constant. During the process of deep breathing with the thoracic diaphragm adopts a lower<br>
               position in the core and this helps to generate intra-abdominal pressure which strengthens the lumbar spine. Most people<br>
               do not get the nessary amount of oxigen do to breathing that is counter productive. keeping an expanded chest and breathing by<br>
               using the diaphram allows for more oxigen to enter the body. the diaphram pushes the lungs up in to the open chest cavity<br>
          to empty the co2. </p>

                Phrasing, Volume, and Performance room. Too much is pushing and can cause tension in the vocal track. If you were <br>
                to use the same amount of support at the beginging of a phrase that you would at the end, you would be <br>
                pushing. The opisite of this is also true. Using the same amount of support you would at the begining at the end wouldn't<br>
                be able to suport the sound needed, including consonants.</p>

               <p>The vocal cords are composed of twin infoldings of<strong> 3 </strong>distinct tissues: The outer layer is <strong>squamous,</strong> non-keratinizing epithelium. <br>
                Below this is the superficial layer of the <strong>lamina propria,</strong> a gel like layer, which allows the vocal fold to vibrate and produce <br>
                sound. The <strong>vocalis and thyroarytenoid muscles</strong> make up the deepest portion. These vocal folds are covered with a mucous membrane <br>
                and are stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx.  The inner lining surface of this squamous epithelium is <br>
                covered by a layer of mucus (acting as a mucociliary clearance), which is composed of two layers: a mucinous layer and serous layer. <br>
                Both mucus layers provide viscous and watery environment for cilia beating posteriorly and superiorly. The mucociliary clearance <br>
                keeps the vocal folds essentially moist and lubricated. Knowing that the falsetto voice is created when the muscle of the vocal folds<br> 
                are not being used. This knowledge comes in handy when a singer is having issues singing high notes, or singing up to high notes. <br> 
                <strong> There is a percentage of vibration in each part of the vocal folds, the higher you sing, the less of the muscular part is used. </strong> </p>

            <p> Resonation chambers are where the bodies natural areas of amplification takes place. The two main places that resonation takes place are <br>
                   the head and the thoracic chamber. Head voice is when more resonation happens in the head and chest voice is when more resonation <br>
                   happens in the chest, singers also have a chest plate and a face plate for amplification. More resonation in the chest is best for <br>
                   lower voiced singers and more in the head for higher voiced singers. Resonation also happens in the Pharynx, Nasal, oral, Sinus cavities,<br>
                   amoung other places. Some chambers can be trained to create more space; like an expanded chest with a lowered diaprahm and a lowered jaw <br>
                   with a forward tongue, a loward larynx and a lifted soft palate. Creating more space in the chest, throat and mouth allowing for a bigger voice. It is importand to remember that<br> 
                   muscles can and do sit over resonating chamber and can effect this. </p>

                <p>  A vowel is a syllabic speech sound that is pronounced without any stricture in the vocal tract. <br> 
                     There are 5 pure vowels that all other vowels are a mix of. These 5 pure vowels that also consist<br> 
                     of no dipthongs<tr> <td class="ipa"> (ɛ, e, ɑ, ɔ, u). </td> <tr> Each of these 5 pure vowels are so special <br> 
                     to a singers mouth position because it establishes a good mouth embouchure that aids a singer with diction.<br>
                     unfortunitly, some of these vowels also carry bad habbits like dipthongs and unnessary movement of articulators.<br>
                     The <tr> <td class="ipa"> (e) </td> <tr> vowel helps to pull the tongue forward but, the down side it that it can close the jaw. On the othe hand,<br>
                     <tr> <td class="ipa"> (ɑ). </td> <tr> vowel helps to lower the jaw and larynx, but it can also pull the tongue back. The <tr> <td class="ipa"> (ɔ).</td> <tr> vowel helps to establish<br>
                     a rounded lip position and is good for blending with others. The <tr> <td class="ipa"> (u). </td> <tr> vowel helps to keep the sides of a singers <br>
                     lips more forward and is great to prevent spreading lips and loosing air. The (u) vowel prevents the natural tentancy <br>
                     to spread the sides of the lips that can be caused by the (e) vowel. The <tr> <td class="ipa"> (ɛ) </td> <tr> vowelhelps to lift the <br>
                     cheeks and upper lip to allow sound to hit the hard surface of the teeth to creat a brighter sound. Good diction happens when <br>
                     the jaw is lowered, the toungue is forward, and the lips are more puckered. This happens because the singers articulators <br>
                     are closer together and don't need to take the time to keep repositioning for articulation. </p>

                 <p> A consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with all or partial closure of the vocal tract. There aer an array of<br>
                     consonants a singer has at their disposal. Voice Fricitives (v,th,z)  really help loosen the muscles of the articulators through <br>
                     their vibrations. Unvoiced Fricitives (f,s,sh) really help a singer with support because of the air blockedge created. voice<br>
                     Plosives (p,t,k) can act like a clapper of a bell  that helps project a singers voice and the nasil consonants (m,n,ng) really help to<br>
                     activate the resonating chambers. Unvoice plosives, or implosives (B,d,g) are very helpful to understand the ratio of support between consonants <br>
                     and vowels. </p>

                 <p> The focus is the deliberate muscular movements that are focused in an area to produce a sound that <br> 
                     can be well heard and understood. Almost every room has a focal point. A central point that all sound <br>
                     vibrations are naturally drawn to by the acoustics of the room. This is the point in the room that all <br> 
                     sound returns to after bouncing off the surfaces in the room. A focused voice is like a focused laser beam,<br>

                 <p> An overtone is any tone greater than the fundamental frequency of a sound and together are called harmonics. <br>
                     Harmonic partials, are partials whose frequencies are numerical integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. <br>
                     The fundamental note being sung in a given room vibrates at a specific Hz causing a secondary vibration in said room. <br>
                     This secondary vibration is double the Hz of the fundamental frequency of an octave higher and is known as the 1st over tone. <br>
                     The vibration from the 1nd over tone creates a 3rd over tone that is double the Hz of the 1st overtone making it an octave and a <br>
                     fifth above the fundamental note being sung. Each over tone being double the Hz of the tone below it. </p>

                 <p> Formants are close groupings of overtones in a given room. These close groupings of overtones are created by the <br>
                     fundamental tone created by each resonating chamber of the singer that amplifies the voice like a bell over any orchestra. </p> </div>
