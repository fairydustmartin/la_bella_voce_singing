          <p> In humans, posture can provide a significant amount of important information through nonverbal communication.<br>
              Psychological studies have also demonstrated the effects of body posture on emotions. The theories that guide <br> 
              research in this field are the self-validation or perception theory and the embodied emotion theory. </br>
              A good singers posture may best be approached by finding a foundation built through a neutral position that <br> 
              exerts the least amount of energy. body positioning that favors the best functioning of all body parts. <br> 
              Such positioning balances the distribution of weight, putting the least strain in muscle, tendons, <br> 
              ligaments and bones. </p>

           <p> Breathing (or ventilation) is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs to facilitate gas exchange <br>
               with the internal environment, mostly by bringing in oxygen and flushing out carbon dioxide. <P/>
               
           <p> All aerobic creatures need oxygen for cellular respiration, which uses the oxygen to break down foods for energy <br> 
               and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. The body's circulatory system transports these gases to and from the ,<br>
               cells, where "cellular respiration" takes place. Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, <br>
               and unconsciously, controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and <br> 
               oxygen in the arterial blood constant.<p/>

           <p> During the process of deep breathing, the thoracic diaphragm adopts a lower position in the core and this helps to <br>
               generate intra-abdominal pressure which strengthens the lumbar spine.</p>

            <p> The vocal cords, also known as vocal folds, are folds of tissue in the Larynx that are key in creating sounds. <br>
                They are composed of twin infoldings of mucous membrane stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx. <br>
                They vibrate, modulating the flow of air being expelled from the lungs during phonation. The Glottis is the area created <br>
                when the vocal folds are open, when the glottis is closed and enough air pressure is built up in the sub-glottis, the Vocal <br>
                Folds begin the phonology process by flapping back and forth creating a vibration and sound. </p>
          
            <p> The vocal cords are composed of twin infoldings of 3 distinct tissues: The outer layer is squamous, non-keratinizing epithelium. <br>
                Below this is the superficial layer of the lamina propria, a gel like layer, which allows the vocal fold to vibrate and produce <br>
                sound. The vocalis and thyroarytenoid muscles make up the deepest portion. These vocal folds are covered with a mucous membrane <br>
                and are stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx.  The inner lining surface of this squamous epithelium is <br>
                covered by a layer of mucus (acting as a mucociliary clearance), which is composed of two layers: a mucinous layer and serous layer. <br>
                Both mucus layers provide viscous and watery environment for cilia beating posteriorly and superiorly. The mucociliary clearance <br>
                keeps the vocal folds essentially moist and lubricated. </p>

               <p> Resonation chambers are where the bodies natural areas of amplification takes place. The two main places that resonation takes place are <br>
                   the head and the thoracic chamber. Head voice is when more resonation happens in the head and chest voice is when more resonation <br>
                   happens in the chest, singers also have a chest plate and a face plate for amplification. More resonation in the chest is best for <br>
                   lower voiced singers and more in the head for higher voiced singers. Resonation also happens in the Pharynx, Nasal, oral, Sinus cavities,<br>
                   amoung other places. Some chambers can be trained to create more space; like an expanded chest with a lowered diaprahm and a lowered jaw <br>
                   with a forward tongue. Creating more space in the chest, throat and mouth allowing for a bigger voice. </p>

                 <p> A vowel is a syllabic speech sound that is pronounced without any stricture in the vocal tract. <br> 
                     There are 5 pure vowels that all other vowels are a mix of. These 5 pure vowels that also consist<br> 
                     of no dipthongs<tr> <td class="ipa"> (ɛ, e, ɑ, ɔ, u). </td> <tr> Each of these 5 pure vowels are so special <br> 
                     to a singers mouth position because it establishes a good mouth embouchure that aids a singer with diction.<br>
                     unfortunitly, some of these vowels also carry bad habbits like dipthongs and unnessary movement of articulators.<br>
                     The long (e) vowel helps to pull the tongue forward but, the down side it that it can close the jaw. On the othe hand,<br>
                     The alpha (a) vowel helps to lower the jaw, but it can also pull the tongue back. The open (o) vowel helps to establish<br>
                     a rounded lip position. The close (u) vowel helps to keep the sides of a singers lips more forward and is great to <br>
                     prevent spreading lips. The (u) vowel prevents the natural tentancy to spread the sides of the lips that can be <br>
                     cause by the (e) vowel this is why it's location on the vowel IPA chart in the front. Good diction happens<br>
                     when the jaw is lowered, the toungue is forward, and the lips are more puckered. The reason for this is the <br>
                     singers articulators are closer together and don't need to take the time to keep repositioning for articulation. </p>

                 <p> The focus is the deliberate muscular movements that are focused in an area to produce a sound that <br> 
                     can be well heard and understood. Almost every room has a focal point. A central point that all sound <br>
                     vibrations are naturally drawn to by the acoustics of the room. This is the point in the room that all <br> 
                     sound returns to after bouncing off the surfaces in the room. </p>

                 <p> An overtone is any frequency greater than the fundamental frequency of a sound and together are called harmonics. <br>
                     Harmonic partials, are partials whose frequencies are numerical integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. <br>
                     The fundamental note being sung in a given room vibrates at a specific Hz causing a secondary vibration in said room. <br>
                     This secondary vibration is double the Hz of the note being sung that is an octave higher and is known as the 1st over tone. <br>
                     The vibration from the 1nd over tone creates a 3rd over tone that is double the Hz of the 1st  and making it an octave and a <br>
                     fifth above the fundamental note being sung. Each over tone being double the Hz of the tone below it. </p>

                   the given room. </p>
